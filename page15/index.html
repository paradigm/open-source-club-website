<p>…atleast our mailing list has caught fire.</p>

<p>Who would have thought “Linux vs. Windows” would have drawn any attention? I just want to rehash a comment made during our latest meeting “This week in slashdot” where +5 points was awarded for mentioning that “the Internet is not a drug”…</p>

<p>A dual perspective approach to the Net Neutrality debate. Think of it as driving on the highway and you can go 60mph for a regular rate, or 80mph at a more expensive rate. Everyone is in favor of being able to pay more to go faster, but net neutrality adds that the guy at 60 should be able to go everywhere that the guy at 80 can go without additional charges.</p>

<p>That might or might not be accurate, but it has scary things in it like the Patriot Act, but nobody has actually read either one.</p>

<p>Conclusion: unresolved</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2006/09/21/welcome-back/">Welcome Back!</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-21-2006</span>
<p>Hello all, I hope everyone had a great summer and is ready for the next quarter of the Opensource Club to begin! We have a couple of important events occurring within the first few weeks of the quarter I’d like to talk a bit about, since they are new and exciting. The Opensource Club will be taking part in the Student Involvement Fair on September 18th. We will have a table in the Technology section of the fair. The Student Involvement Fair will be held from 12:00 noon to 4:00pm on the Oval and will include dozens of student organizations and thousands of attendees. This is a great chance to advertise ourselves to the incoming freshmen class and to all students of Ohio State. Then on September 30th is Ohio LinuxFest 2006! LinuxFest will be held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in downtown Columbus. We are also proudly taking part in this event, with a table of our own. There will speakers, vendor and community exhibits, and plenty of swag. Information can be found on the Ohio LinuxFest website, and more will be added to the site soon. This is a chance to show the greater community our spirit and resolve to be a great community player. Both events are completely free to attend, but it should be noted that Ohio LinuxFest requires all attendees to register by September 22. LinuxFest is offering an All Conference Pass for $65.00, which is completely optional, and includes several perks, all detailed on the attendance page. We will be organizing a group of attendees once the date draws closer. I will send out more detailed e-mails about each event as they draw nearer. Now, we are currently in the planning stages, but one thing we would like to give away at both events is a flier detailing ourselves and listing at least our first five or six meetings of the quarter. For this, we need speakers. I’d like to ask for five speakers to offer to give presentations for the first few meetings of the quarter. We want to show anyone interested in our organization that we are alive, kicking, and in full-swing for the up-and-coming year. This year we will be continuing in the alternating Tuesday/Thursday at 7:00pm format that we used last year, since it seemed to work well for most people. If it turns out to not be the best way to continue, we can discuss alternate ideas. Barring any problems, here is my tentative schedule of meeting dates: Monday 9/18: Student Involvement Fair Thursday 9/21: Welcome Back with Alex! Tuesday 9/26: Speaker needed Saturday 9/30: Ohio LinuxFest 2006 Thursday 10/5: Speaker needed Tuesday 10/10: Speaker needed Thursday 10/19: Speaker needed Tuesday 10/24: Speaker needed If anyone is interested in speaking during those dates, feel free to contact me at lingo.13@osu.edu or by replying to this topic. I am looking forward to seeing the Opensource Club as strong as ever in the coming months, and these two events are a good way to start upon that road.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2006/09/21/welcome-back-with-alex-ideas-for-ohio-linuxfest/">Welcome Back with Alex! / Ideas for Ohio LinuxFest</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-21-2006</span>
<p>Date: 09/21/2006
Time: 7:00PM
Room: 480 Dreese Labs</p>

<p>Welcome back for the 2006-2007 school year! Come and find out what we are planning for this year for the Opensource Club and share your thoughts and ideas. Would you like to see less talk and more rock? Then come and voice your opinion! We are especially interesting in your ideas for the upcoming Ohio LinuxFest 2006. Linuxfest is a free conference of over a dozen open-source sponsors and twenty speakers, all celebrating the greatness that in Linux and open source. This year, The Opensource Club will have its very own booth set up for the conference. We need to come up with ideas on how we can use this awesome opportunity to reach out to the greater Linux and open source community. Months ago I made the decision to use <a href="http://opensource.osu.edu/microwiki">Microwiki</a> as the base of our website, replacing the <a href="http://opensource.osu.edu/old_site/">old HTML site</a> that we had previously. At around the same time, <a href="http://freegeekcolumbus.org/">Freegeek Columbus</a> switched from <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> - the software that drives Wikipedia - to Mircowiki, and they seemed happy enough. It seemed a good choice for us. I thought that we should use something small and simple. Microwiki, weighing in at just 163 kilobytes, is undoubtably small and simple. However, as time wore on, it became clear that MicroWiki was not the best tool for the job. I pressed on, thinking that I could make it work. I never did. Here is a quick list of various problems I ran into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were woefully few options, which at first I had thought a good idea, but it became obvious that this was a problem.</li>
  <li>There was no form of user management - unless you could phpMyAdmin.</li>
  <li>Current users could register new users. Eventually this broke, and new users had to be added through database tricks and magic.</li>
  <li>File/image upload never actually worked.</li>
  <li>External links and images could not be embeded with standard HTML. Wiki syntax <em>had</em> to be used.</li>
  <li>It was hard to theme. Different parts of the site were in different places, the CSS was hidden away in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few days ago I made the decision to kick Microwiki to the curb, and I haven’t looked back since. Here’s a short and sweet list of some new features this Drupal-based website can offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User management, including profiles, user roles, and access controls.</li>
  <li>Simpler editing tools. HTML!</li>
  <li>File uploads now work, and users can attach files to their stories and pages.</li>
  <li>Polls! What do you think about tax cuts for the upper tax bracket? Now we can find out!</li>
  <li>Extensibility, through hundreds of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Modules">modules</a>.</li>
  <li>Comments, with simple and powerful moderation.</li>
  <li>Easy theming. I made this theme by modifying the default Drupal theme with just CSS, in a file!</li>
</ul>

<p>That was just off the top of my head, and I think I will find many modules that will add great new features as time goes on. Enjoy the new site. It is not complete, I am about 95% of the way there. The last 5% is just tightening things up and changing some things here and there. Soon I will be posting information about <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest</a> and our participation, so be on the lookout for that soon. Feel free and <a href="http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/?q=user/register">register</a>, and don’t hesitate to leave comments on what you think. – Alex</p>

<p>On September 30, 2006 <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest 2006</a> will occur at the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend_travel.html">Greater Columbus Convention Center</a>. This event will draw over a dozen sponsors, twenty speakers, and nearly two-thousand attendees.</p>

<p>The Open Source Club is proud to once again play a part in an event which began on The Ohio State University campus. As a .org level sponsor, we will be attending and manning our own booth this year. We will draw up plans for our booth once the date draws closer. What is important now is for everyone who wished to attend to <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend.html">register</a> on the official Ohio LinuxFest 2006 website <strong>before Friday, September 22 2006</strong>. Registration is strictly limited to 1,968 attendees, so it is in your best interest to register <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>This year Ohio LinuxFest is offering two conference passes. The first option is the <em>Free Conference Pass</em>, which offers access to the presentations and expo. The second option is a new <em>All Conference Pass</em>, which in addition to the presentations and expo includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to the Conference Suite at the Holiday Inn</li>
  <li>Lunch on the Day of the Conference</li>
  <li>Drink tickets for the After Conference Party</li>
  <li>An Ohio Linuxfest T-Shirt</li>
  <li>Rockstar Style Backstage Pass</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of the All Conference Pass is $65.00, which goes only into defraying the cost of running Ohio LinuxFest.</p>

<p>You can find more information about Ohio LinuxFest 2006 on their <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">offical website</a>, including the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/speakers.html">List of speakers</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/schedule.html">conference schedule</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2006/09/10/updated-student-involvement-fair-ohio-linuxfest-pamphlet/">Updated: Student Involvement Fair/Ohio LinuxFest pamphlet</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-10-2006</span>
<p>As part of our participation in the <a href="http://ohiounion.osu.edu/studentorgs/events_involvement.asp">Student Involvement Fair</a> and <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org">Ohio LinuxFest 2006</a> I’d like to hand out pamphets that showcase who we are and our upcoming meetings. I’ve started work on it, and would appriciate any idea or comments you may have on it. You can download it at the bottom of the page in OpenDocument and PDF formats. Edit: The automatic uploader is not working, due to possible SELinux issues. I’ve linked to the files manually, and will look into the issue. Release notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is in greyscale, as color printed through SOURCE is more expensive.</li>
  <li>It is 3 2/3” x 8”, so three can be printed on a single sheet of 8” x 11” paper.</li>
  <li>
    <strike>Peter hasn't confirmed with me that he will give his talk on 10/19.</strike>
  </li>
  <li>Jim hasn’t decided on the topic of his talk, so I have put “Kitten Huffing” as a placeholder until he does.</li>
  <li>
    <strike>I'm going to rewrite the "Welcome Back!" text.</strike>
  </li>
  <li>Part of the open source description and the net neutrality description are taken from Wikipedia. I plan on rewriting the net neutrality copy, but like the open source description. If we use it, we will have to place a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.txt">GNU Free Documentation License</a> boilerplate at the bottom.</li>
  <li>The pamphlet will be updated for Ohio LinuxFest to remove references to previous meetings and to include information on more upcoming meetings.</li>
  <li>I’ve added a condensed form of Peter’s talk description.</li>
  <li>I’ve changed the size of the OSUOSS logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those who do not want to download the files, here is the complete text of the pamphlet:</p>
