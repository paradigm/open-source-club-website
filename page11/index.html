<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/04/30/this-week-in-slashdot/">This Week In Slashdot</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-30-2010</span>
<p>This <strong>Thursday, May 6th at 7PM in <em>Caldwell 133</em> (note the change),</strong> Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/04/30/open-source-gaming/">Open Source Gaming</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-30-2010</span>
<p>This <strong>Thursday, May 20th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be discussing open source gaming, gaming on Linux, gaming with <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/">WINE</a>, and just general options for gaming once you switch to an open source operating system. One complaint that seems common in the open source OS world is that gaming is pretty much thrown out the window once you have made the switch. We would like to spend the meeting debunking this myth and showing all of the options that one has in the open source gaming arena. We will be showing pure open source games, games that you probably didn’t know ran natively in Linux, and how gaming in <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/">WINE</a> has improved by leaps and bounds recently and actually does a relatively good job with some of our beloved games that only work on Windows. So come on out and join the discussion and hopefully learn how you are not totally hopeless gaming wise when switching to an open source operating system!</p>

<p>This Meeting is in preparation for our LAN party that we are hosting Saturday, May 22nd! There will be more information provided at the meeting and you can join our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce">announcement mailing list</a> for up to date information, or check the <a href="/lan">wiki</a>!</p>

<p>This <strong>Thursday, April 29th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 317,</strong> we will be spending the meeting time attempting to install Linux on anything. We have members with PS3’s, iPods, XBOX’s, Wii’s, phones and whatever else you can think of and we are going to attempt to install an operating system of our choice on them. These members are volunteering their hardware for the meeting and recognize that performing these actions may violate warranties and are not responsible for attempts made meeting goers’ own electronics. We are only showing these demonstrations as proof of concept that it is possible to put your own software on hardware that, when it boils down to it, is essentially just a computer built for a specific purpose. So, if you are interested in talking about trying to put Linux on anything and everything, come on out and join in on the fun. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>This Thursday, June 3rd at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305, Robert Joseph will be presenting on the scripting language Perl.  This timing fits nicely because the Open Source Club is hosting Yet Another Perl Conference::North America 2010 later this month and we felt it was appropriate that we should prepare ourselves.

<p>This <strong>Thursday, April 22nd at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> Jesse Amundsen, a student in the Physics and Geology department at Northern Kentucky University, will discuss the current state of open source geographic information systems (GIS). This will include a brief introduction to the components, functions, and uses of a GIS followed by an exploration of current open source offerings and how they compare to the current proprietary powerhouse that is ESRI’s ArcGIS. Some open source software projects such as GRASS, GDAL, libLAS, and the adoption of spatial database extensions will be covered in more depth. A research project that is using exclusively open source software to delineate landslides in the Cincinnati metropolitan area will be presented. The talk will conclude with a demonstration of how to access public LiDAR and aerial imagery data for the state of Ohio and how to load it into an open source GIS.</p>

<p>This <strong>Thursday, May 13th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> Daniel Thau will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a demonstration will be given to show how one would go about locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

<p>This <strong>Thursday, April 15th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be hosting a discussion session revolving around tips, tricks, and time savers that people have discovered. Do you think you have an awesome .bashrc, .vimrc, key binding, or a little known useful program and want to show it off? This would be the perfect opportunity to share with the rest of the club. There are lots of nifty things that are not widely known and we think this would be a good opportunity to share your knowledge of time savers with others! We will not be using the typical presentation format in lieu of a more informal discussion atmosphere, so feel free to come on out and share your tips as well as learn some new ones at the same time. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>This <strong>Thursday, April 8th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,</strong> we will be holding a lightning talk session focusing on programming languages. It came to our attention that knowledge of different languages was fragmented amongst meeting goers so we decided that we should each take turns introducing each other to languages that we have learned and think others would appreciate or find useful. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that each focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. Thus far we have had volunteers for the following languages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>Bash</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Lisp</li>
  <li>Perl</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be attaching demos and slides from the talks as they are available, so check back.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/03/18/wireless-printing-in-linux/">Wireless Printing in Linux</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 03-18-2010</span>
<p>If you go to Uniprint’s <a href="http://uniprint.osu.edu/printman/osuprintmap/">wireless printing</a> page, you’ll see it is possible to print to most public printers from anywhere on OSU’s network, such as osuwireless. However, Uniprint only supports Mac and Windows; Linux users are out of luck and left with the options of either installing a new operating system to print their documents or using a lab computer (if available). Therefore, we in the Open Source Club have decided to publish a tutorial so fellow Linux users can print to their libraries from their laptops or dorm rooms just like Windows/Mac users can.</p>

<p>First, we need to have CUPS installed. This is the default in many Linux distributions as far as I know. If it’s not installed by default, please <a href="/comment/reply/241#comment-form">leave a comment</a>.</p>

<p>With CUPS installed, go to <a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/</a> and click on <img src="/sites/default/files/button-add-printer_0.gif" alt="Add Printer" />. Fill in your own description and pick a meaningful description location that you will remember later on (e.g. <em>Science &amp; Engineering Library, Color Printer</em>). For the printer <strong>Name</strong>, you will want to look up your printer in the table below. Fill it in and click on <img src="/sites/default/files/button-continue_0.gif" alt="" />.</p>

<p>On the next page, select “<em>LPD/LPR Host or Printer</em>” for the device and click <img src="/sites/default/files/button-continue_0.gif" alt="" />. Now, for <strong>Device URI</strong>, fill in the URI shown in the table <a href="#printerlist">below</a>. For example, if I want to print to the printer in room 45 of Thompson Library, I would enter <u>lpd://128.146.12.138/li0045-hp4200mobile</u>. Now, select the printer’s manufacturer (should be in the model name) for <a href="/sites/default/files/cups_manufacturer_page.png">Make</a>. If the instructions for your printer below mention uploading a PPD file instead of saying the model, upload it here; otherwise, in the <a href="/sites/default/files/cups_model_page.png">table that comes up</a> select the closest match to the corresponding printer model (listed below). When your web browser prompts you for a username and password, enter the administrative username/password for the computer you’re on, or the username/password of some other user in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lpadmin</code> group. You may be redirected to a page with a lot of optional configurations options. At this point all of your applications should be able to use that printer, and have it listed as one of your installed printers, but you may wish to customize your settings for it. Remember that you will still need to swipe your BuckID at the print station to pay for and release your print job.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The installers from Uniprint will install a <a href="/sites/default/files/pharos_popup.png">Popup Client</a> program, which asks for a username, password, and title. This is not (yet) possible for Linux. Instead, the username will be the username you’re logged into your computer with and the title will be whatever the title is of what you’re printing. There will be no password. This means that from the time you send your document to the printer queue, until the time you go and pick it up, anybody can swipe their ID to pick it up. <strong><em><u>Do not send confidential or sensitive information</u></em></strong> to the printer because it is not possible to password protect it, even though Uniprint’s proprietary program will add a password.</p>

<p>Due to mitigating circumstances we will not be having our <a href="/batterylife-wi10">maximizing battery talk</a> this week. In lieu of this we will be holding a hackathon in its stead. This <strong><em>Thursday, February 18th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266</em></strong>, we will be hacking on all sorts of code. We have several projects going at the moment that range from python to C and hackers of all skill levels are invited. Whether you know nothing about programming or are a kernel wizard come join us and play around with some code. There will be no formal structure to this meeting, just bring your laptop and/or your brain and you will be able to hack along. You may want to familiarize yourself slightly with the projects in <a href="/git">gitweb</a> and find one or more you may want to work on. Of course you could also bring your own. As always, there will be pizza.</p>

<p>This Thursday January 28th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, Morgan Goose will be showing off a multitude of GNU Utilties. Here is Morgan’s synopsis of his talk:</p>

<p>This presentation is going to try and cover a lot of ground, and at variable speed. I am trying to get it into two somewhat logical parts.</p>

<p>First being where I into regex then show its use with sed. Then go into using awk, and finally how to use find.</p>

<p>The second half will try and touch on the rest of the commands, concentrating on grep, xargs, and process management.</p>

<p>I also will leave off with a slide or two of fun one liners, and some bash tricks, that people may find super useful.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/25/gimp-spring-2010/">GIMP - Spring 2010</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-25-2010</span>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Due to inexcusably poor service from classroom services, the meeting was moved to Dreese Lab 305 for the current meeting. We apologize for the short notice, and plan on inquiring into why our room was overbooked without our knowledge.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7PM in <s>Dreese Labs 266</s>, Brian Swaney demonstrated how to effectively utilize the open source photo editing suite GIMP.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. The presentation was therefore interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was encouraged. Questions were also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>At the meeting, there was a lot of demand for a demonstration of rendering lightning bolts. <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">Here</a> is a copy of the example XCF image I generated. I followed <a href="http://www.gimptalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=122#pagecontent">this tutorial</a> up to the point where they changed the colorization, then instead selected/cut out the bolt by color, applied the neon filter, and flattened the bolt. The image with Richard Stallman and Bill Gates was also popular, so you’ll find it <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those out there who continue to persist that “GIMP is inferior to Photoshop and will never be professional,” well… here is a little something by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/krc453">krc453</a>…</p>
