will present a tour of Vim functionality.  Prior Vim experience is not
required.  This presentation will aim to cover things at a high-level in
order to cover a broad number of Vim subsystems.  This is done in the
hopes of getting to new topics not covered in previous OSC Vim
presentations.  However, but if requested the presenter can go into
further detail on any of the discussed items - do not hesitate to speak
up and ask for further detail.  A list of <code class="highlighter-rouge">:help</code>-able items will be
provided after the presentation to reference to minimize the need for
note-taking.</p>

<p>Update on the stallman2 migration: It’s happening! The largest of the remaining tasks has been completed and we’re almost all set to go. Downtime will be scheduled this Friday starting at 3pm until I have no clue when as we do a final sync of the data, physically move the hardware, and verify that everything is operating correctly. Since stallman2 is a fresh start, it may not have all the software that stallman currently has. I’ll try to install some commonly used software, but if there’s something specific you want please email me at osler.6 to request it. Especially if you’d like a DE other than Unity or i3, since that’s all that’s installed so far. Please note that the new machine will be Ubuntu 14.04 (from 12.04) and will be 64 bit (from 32 bit).</p>
