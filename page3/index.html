<p>Thursday, 2015-01-22, Jon Arnett (President of the Collegiate Web Developer Group here on campus) and Eli Gladman will present “Intro to Web Development”. A description from Jon follows:</p>

<p>Eli and I will be giving an introduction to web development using Ruby on Rails. Ruby is an open source programming language that first surfaced in the 90’s, and gained popularity through it’s expressive syntax and powerful features, such as metaprogramming. The Rails web development framework is written in Ruby, and is known for allowing developers to iterate extremely quickly. To illustrate this point, we intend to build a functional (though perhaps unstyled) blog in a fraction of the time it would take to write in another language or framework.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/11/04/intellidu/">Intellidu</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 11-04-2014</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2014-11-06 in Caldwell Labs 120, John Simerlink will present his project “Intellidu”. His blurb follows:</p>

<p>Basically I’m building an education platform with a few friends that heavily uses data analytics and A/B testing to allow teacher to iteratively improve their courses. Teachers or uses will be able to empirically test out educational psychology research and apply them into any course imaginable.</p>

<p>“Intellidu”: Our app is designed to make you learn the quickest possible in any subject.</p>

<p>Our app will let you learn up to 2x faster, by spacing your content for review at just the right time, be it Spanish flashcards or algebra exercises. This means you aren’t studying too much or too little. This is known as Spaced Repetition.</p>

<p>Anyone can create courses on our app. Likewise, through a process similar to Wikipedia, anyone can edit/ make suggestions to courses to make them better, following a set of standards developed from education research.</p>

<p>Course creators can optimize their courses through experiments. If Jim creates a Spanish course, he could assign a small portion of his users to a different version of his course, to see if that variation of the course makes students learn quicker.</p>

<p>We will host other features that make you learn as fast as possible, such as gamification (making learning like a video game) and course integration (you won’t have to be retaught the same content you learned in another course)</p>

<p>You will be able to study any subject on your computer or mobile device, for example chemistry through handwriting recognition on your tablet.</p>

<p>We plan to be FREE and open-source.</p>

<p>We plan to have a Beta Release of our minimum viable product this December</p>

<p>The KEY FEATURE is that we time how long it takes each user to learn each fact. This forms the foundation of our app, letting any developer or researcher come along to test if their teaching or studying method lets people learn quicker.</p>

<p>Initial project/”Minimum Viable Product”:</p>

<p>Simply a flashcard web app, that has a timer in the background tracking how long it takes you to learn each piece of information.</p>

<p>We’re going to be open source, and within a few months will be reaching out to people to join along. We are also going to register as a nonprofit.</p>

<p>Thursday, 2014-10-23 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Patrick Shuff (an engineer at Facebook) will present “Open Source at Facebook”. Description follows:</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/10/15/elixir/">Elixir</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-15-2014</span>
<p>Thursday, 2014-10-30 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Jon Arnett will present Elixir. Description follows:</p>

<p>From the metaphorical ashes of the mostly-forgotten language Erlang, arises a promising successor, Elixir. With an intuitive syntax inherited from Ruby, Elixir takes the power of Erlang, and makes it accessible to even novice programmers. Elixir includes all of the most impressive features from it’s predecessor, such as the functional paradigm, hot-swapping of code, and fault-tolerance or the “let it crash” philosophy. In this talk, I will cover the basics of Elixir, including syntax and data structures, and a brief overview of Elixir’s build tool, Mix, as well as covering some of the philosophies that contributed to the formation of the language.</p>

<p>Jon Arnett is president of the Collegiate Web Developer’s Group at Ohio State. Visit http://cwdg.github.io for more information.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/09/29/zimbra-open-source-mail-and-groupware/">Zimbra: Open Source Mail and Groupware</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-29-2014</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2014-10-02 in Caldwell Labs 120, William Osler will present Zimbra: Open Source Mail &amp; Groupware. Description follows.</p>

<p>Email has been the core of how we communicate via the internet for longer than some of us have been alive, but in modern times can involve a complex interaction between various systems to get your message from point A to point B. But it doesn’t have to be hard. I’ll be going over Zimbra, an open source mail and groupware solution that you can host and run yourself. With the right server and a domain name, you can take control of your email, calendar, contacts and files and have the convenience of “the cloud” without the PRISM.</p>

<p>I will be doing a live demo of setup during this meeting, and you can follow along if you have previous GNU/Linux experience. You’ll need a VPS with at least 2 GB of memory running Ubuntu 12.04 and a domain name set up and pointing to the box. You can download the necessary files ahead of time at http://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/09/08/wireless-security/">Wireless Security</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-08-2014</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2014/09/11 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present Wireless Security. In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>I reiterate, <b>DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</b></p>

<p>In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/
For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 24th 2014 in Caldwell Labs 120, C. Matthew Curtin will present “Cracking the Data Encryption Standard.”</p>

<p>Matt was one of the leaders of the DESCHALL project that cracked a message encrypted with the then-US-Government-Standard 56-bit DES using idle cycles of computers connected over the Internet. His book, Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard, is the memoir of that project, and the presentation will give an inside look into one of the largest computations ever performed, forcing a change in US policy, and looking back and seeing how what happened then relates to the present policy issues regarding the relationship between the government and its citizenry online.</p>

<p>This will be our last official meeting of the 2013-2014 academic year, so we will do a goodbye to seniors.</p>

<p>As always, there will be pizza. Expect it to be a little nicer than usual.</p>
