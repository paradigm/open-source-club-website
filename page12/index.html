<p>This Thursday, March 11th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be holding a lightning talk session covering a multitude of command line applications. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. If you are looking for a lightweight program to get the job done and don’t need a graphical interface, be it checking your mail, downloading torrents, chatting on irc, editing text, or anything else, this is definitely the meeting for you. If you have found a command line program that has grasped your interest, consider coming in and sharing with the rest of the club as we are all looking for the next best thing. A current list of programs that are going to be covered is in a list below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tmux</li>
  <li>screen</li>
  <li>mplayer</li>
  <li>htop</li>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/25/alternative-window-managers/">Alternative Window Managers</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-25-2010</span>
<p>Thursday February 11th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be discussing alternative open source window managers for Linux. A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. In other words it creates a desktop environment for you to use on your screen. The big two desktop environments are KDE and Gnome, but we are going to discuss some lesser known alternatives to these two. Matt Meinwald will be discussing Fluxbox and XFCE. Dan Thau will be showing DWM, EvilWM and how to operate with no window manager at all. Finally, Alek Rollyson will be showing OpenBox, wmii and Awesome WM. Come join us and learn about some alternative window managers that you can learn about and use!</p>

<p>This Thursday, January 21st at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will have a few people presenting on the topic of virtualization. Dan Thau will be talking about chroot, what chroot is and what chroot is not, as well as give examples for usage and a demo or two. Matt Meinwald will demonstrate Xen, a popular server virtualization system. He will give some background, including the difference between paravirtualization and full machine virtualization, then will show a demo of creating and administering a virtual machine. Alek Rollyson will cover desktop related virtualization tools such as Virtualbox and VMware. He will go over the features of these programs, what systems they support, and how to configure and administer virtual desktops.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/11/this-week-in-slashdot/">This Week in Slashdot</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-11-2010</span>
<p>This Thursday, January 14th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2009/12/18/wireless-hacking/">Wireless hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 12-18-2009</span>
<p>This Thursday, January 7th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we are doing a talk and demonstration on hacking wireless networks. There will be 3 parts to the discussion. First, Brian Swaney will be talking about the dangers of poor security. He will go over why wireless communication is inherently insecure, what types of attacks are possible on wireless networks, some techniques common people use to try and secure their networks, and why they ultimately fail. Alek Rollyson will then continue on and talk about the behind the scenes technicalities of the attacks that we will be presenting. He will go over some specific weaknesses in protocols used by wireless routers, how they might be exploited, and how to protect oneself. Finally, Michael Yanovich will show us how to use the aircrack-ng suite to actually perform the attacks. He will show how to exploit all the common mistakes users make in securing their network, all using the free, open source aircrack suite. We look forward to seeing you all there. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This presentation is for <u>educational</u> purposes only. Use of these techniques in a manner other than how they are presented may be in violation of state/federal law, and also totally uncool. We do not condone their use for illegal or nefarious purposes.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2009/12/18/emacs/">emacs</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 12-18-2009</span>
<p>This Thursday, February 25<sup>th</sup>, I, Professor Ed Overman, a professor in the math department at Ohio State University, will be presenting on emacs in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266. I began using an 026 keypunch machine in my student days (which clearly did not need an editor). My first interactive time-sharing experience was using CITRAN (which was commonly known as SHITRAN). My first <em>pleasant</em> time-sharing experience was using TECO (TExt COrrector) and SOS (Son Of Stopgap) on Digital Equipment Corporation computers using a 110 baud interactive teletype machine. (The joke was that it was very difficult to differentiate TECO commands from line noise - since phone lines were very noisy in the old days.) Emacs (Editor MACroS) began as a set of macros for TECO and then grew to be the hydralike creature it is today. I will show you the commands I commonly use in writing programs (I will even hand out my <em>cheat sheet</em> for these commands on a sheet of paper!) and hopefully discuss the commands you would like to use. I will come prepared with the emacs reference manual and lisp manual!</p>

<p>This Thursday at 7pm in Dreese Labs 266, Alex Lingo, a former President and Vice President of the club, will be presenting on the much misunderstood topic of LVM. The Logical Volume Manager is a system in the Linux kernel that allows the abstraction of physical data volumes into so called “logical volumes”. For example, with LVM, 3 1TB disks can be combined into a single 3TB linear volume. Alex is going to give a brief overview of how the system works, as well as give a demonstration first hand to show the ins and outs of the system. I hope to see you all there!</p>

<p>This week Alek will be giving an introduction to Linux and an overview a good chunk of the Linux distributions that one has to choose from. We will go over all the pros, cons, features, strengths, setup nuances, requirements, and finally how to pick the perfect distro for your needs. After the overview we will then run through a graphical install of Ubuntu and then a text based install of Debian in order to both show the differences between the distributions and how text and graphical installs differ. Our meeting will be on Thursday October 1st in Dreese Labs room 266 and, as always, the meeting is open to everyone. We especially welcome newcomers to this meeting so we can introduce you to the world of Linux and how to get started! Bring any questions you have and we will be happy to answer. Attached below are the presentation slides from this meeting. There is both an OpenDocument format and a Microsoft Powerpoint format. Enjoy!</p>

<p>This Thursday, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266, we had our first meeting of the 2009/2010 school year. We have many things to do at this meeting, including drafting/revising the constitution, and discussing meeting topics for this quarter. Please note: We are located in Dreese Labs room <strong>266</strong>. This is not in the main part of Dreese, and easily confused with <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=280">Baker Systems and Engineering</a>. The room is near the bridge connecting Dreese and Baker, and to the west. To get there, either enter through Dreese, cross the bridge, and turn right; or enter through Baker and turn left down the long hallway before the bridge.</p>
