<h2 class="bold">Welcome Back!</h2><span class="date">posted: 09-21-2006</span><div class="content"><p>Hello all, I hope everyone had a great summer and is ready for the next quarter of the Opensource Club to begin! We have a couple of important events occurring within the first few weeks of the quarter I’d like to talk a bit about, since they are new and exciting. The Opensource Club will be taking part in the Student Involvement Fair on September 18th. We will have a table in the Technology section of the fair. The Student Involvement Fair will be held from 12:00 noon to 4:00pm on the Oval and will include dozens of student organizations and thousands of attendees. This is a great chance to advertise ourselves to the incoming freshmen class and to all students of Ohio State. Then on September 30th is Ohio LinuxFest 2006! LinuxFest will be held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in downtown Columbus. We are also proudly taking part in this event, with a table of our own. There will speakers, vendor and community exhibits, and plenty of swag. Information can be found on the Ohio LinuxFest website, and more will be added to the site soon. This is a chance to show the greater community our spirit and resolve to be a great community player. Both events are completely free to attend, but it should be noted that Ohio LinuxFest requires all attendees to register by September 22. LinuxFest is offering an All Conference Pass for $65.00, which is completely optional, and includes several perks, all detailed on the attendance page. We will be organizing a group of attendees once the date draws closer. I will send out more detailed e-mails about each event as they draw nearer. Now, we are currently in the planning stages, but one thing we would like to give away at both events is a flier detailing ourselves and listing at least our first five or six meetings of the quarter. For this, we need speakers. I’d like to ask for five speakers to offer to give presentations for the first few meetings of the quarter. We want to show anyone interested in our organization that we are alive, kicking, and in full-swing for the up-and-coming year. This year we will be continuing in the alternating Tuesday/Thursday at 7:00pm format that we used last year, since it seemed to work well for most people. If it turns out to not be the best way to continue, we can discuss alternate ideas. Barring any problems, here is my tentative schedule of meeting dates: Monday 9/18: Student Involvement Fair Thursday 9/21: Welcome Back with Alex! Tuesday 9/26: Speaker needed Saturday 9/30: Ohio LinuxFest 2006 Thursday 10/5: Speaker needed Tuesday 10/10: Speaker needed Thursday 10/19: Speaker needed Tuesday 10/24: Speaker needed If anyone is interested in speaking during those dates, feel free to contact me at lingo.13@osu.edu or by replying to this topic. I am looking forward to seeing the Opensource Club as strong as ever in the coming months, and these two events are a good way to start upon that road.</p>
