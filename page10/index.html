<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/01/chroot-and-linux-from-scatch/">Chroot and Linux From Scatch</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-01-2011</span>
<p>Thursday, January 6th, 2011 at 7:00PM in Dreese 264 (note the change in location), Daniel Thau will be giving a dual presentation covering the chroot operation as well as the Linux From Scratch project.</p>

<p>Chroot, available on all major Unix-y systems, changes the root directory from the point of a selected program and its children.  Effectively, this is somewhat akin to vitalization (with a number of comparative benefits and deficiencies relative to actual vitalization).  Some uses of chroot include the creation of a testing environment, a separated environment for compatibility reasons, limited privilege separation, and recovery of unbootable or otherwise hampered systems.  While chroot is available on other Unix-y systems, the presentation will focus on it’s uses with Linux distributions.</p>

<p>The other topic, Linux From Scratch, is a collection of documentation which walks a user through the processes of creating a functional Linux distribution.  While the base LFS system is fairly minimal, LFS has sister projects (such as Beyond Linux From Scratch) which allow a LFS-based system to (after a lot of work) fit the needs of almost any type of Linux distribution, from an extremely minimal embedded system to a fully featured desktop or server.  More important, perhaps, is the fact that working through the LFS documentation is a great way to learn about the innards of a Linux system.</p>

<p>The week of December 3 is final exams, so we will not be meeting. In addition, the next few weeks are winter break, so our next meeting is Thursday, January 10 at 7 PM. The topic and location are currently unknown. During this break, our <a href="/irc">irc channel</a> and <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">mailing list</a> should still be active and many will be working on projects, <a href="/git">some of which</a> are hosted on our website. Hopefully everyone has an enjoyable break, and we’ll see you next quarter.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/11/29/vim/">Vim</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 11-29-2010</span>
<p>December 2nd at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Vim, an extremely powerful text editing program.  Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost.</p>

<p>Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it.  Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others.  Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim.</p>

<p>Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others.  If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will use this meeting to plan out our schedule for next quarter.  Bring in any ideas you have!</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/11/15/xen-virtualization/">Xen Virtualization</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 11-15-2010</span>
<p>On Thursday, November 18, at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Matt Meinwald will be presenting on Xen, a popular server virtualization system.  He will show what the software has to offer and will demo the installation process on Debian.  Depending on time and interest, he may explain how we use it in the Open Source club systems or compare it to other software out there.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/11/06/the-git-distributed-version-control-system/">The Git Distributed Version Control System</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 11-06-2010</span>
<p>This <strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, November 12th at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Git, a distributed version control system with a focus on performance and integrity. Despite being known as one of the more difficult VCSs to grasp, git has become quite popular and has a fair number of recognizable F/OSS projects using it, such as the Linux Kernel and X.org. Daniel will cover a quick history of Git (lots of tasty drama), cover some pros and cons of using Git, explain what Git is doing under the hood, give a conceptual explanation of what Git does, and of course go over both basic (add, commit, branch, merge, etc) and advanced (stash, rebase, etc) Git usage. Having a laptop with Git installed may be benficial for those in the audience who want to play along, but those without should be perfectly fine. NOTE: Due to veterans day this meeting is on a Friday, not a Thursday!</p>

<p>This Thursday, November 4th at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Jonathan Tubb will be giving an overview of Model View Controllers. A popular architecture for developing web applications, MVCs have come into their own in the past decade becoming the standard for quick deployment of applications. Information, use cases, and examples of MVCs and web applications will be covered.</p>

<p>Also featuring Tubbs witty remarks and dashing good looks, maybe even pizza.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/10/23/this-week-in-slashdot/">This Week in Slashdot</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-23-2010</span>
<p>This Thursday, October 28 at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website that deals in news for the nerdy, specifically “stuff that matters”. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read Slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. This may be Alex’s last quarter at Ohio State, so don’t miss this meeting! It should also be noted that award certificates will be given out to those who can show that they’ve received a comment moderated 3 or better within the last week! There will also be candy tossed out for valuable participation in the discussions during the meeting.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/10/18/why-python/">Why Python?</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-18-2010</span>
<p>This meeting will focus on several aspects of Python that don’t normally come up in normal Python meetings. It will show you how things can be easier and more fun in Python! I will will be covering things from as simply as handling basic data types to more advance things such as making system calls or making the most of the PSL (Python Standard Library).</p>

<p>This meeting will also attempt to cover a small comparison between the larger more known languages: Java and C++, and show how some things can be done easier and quicker than in Java or C++.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, still stop by and maybe you’ll finally take that small leap into the programming world.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/10/07/gimp-image-editing-autumn-2010/">GIMP Image editing - Autumn 2010</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-07-2010</span>
<p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Brian Swaney will be demonstrating use of the GIMP image editor. GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “<em>how do I save as a JPEG</em>” to as advanced as “<em>how do I remove braces?</em>” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.</p>

<p>While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what <em>you</em> want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to <a href="/~swaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">rendering lightning bolts</a>, to making the picture just… <a href="https://box.com/shared/static/qi2ekqlhrupm3bkdnjr3.xcf">lie</a>. By the time you leave, you should qualify as a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200807020002?f=h_top">Fox News editor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a time-lapsed example of what GIMP is capable of in the right hands by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/krc453">krc453</a>:</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/10/01/mua-the-mutt/">Mua the Mutt</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-01-2010</span>
<p>On Thursday, October 7th at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Alek Rollyson will be explaining what Mutt is, what it does, and why you should care. Per Mutt’s mantra, most e-mail clients suck, Mutt just sucks less. Alek will be showcasing Mutt’s capabilities via the story of Mua the Mutt and the adventures in which she partakes. Through a storytelling device, he will explain that Mutt is solely a mail user agent and requires other pieces and parts in order to function as a complete email solution. Once the entire system is complete, the user will have powerful regex capabilities, email threading, offline email access, pgp encryption and signing, sending and receiving from multiple addresses, 256 color inbox sorting, and synching with gmail if one wishes. This meeting will be perfect for those who are scared of Mutt’s complexity, tried Mutt and got frustrated, looking to improve their Mutt setup, or have no idea what Mutt is but want an extremely powerful and 1337 email setup.</p>

<p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Matt Smith will be demonstrating an Open Music Server that he has been working on. It might seem too easy and obvious to bother with in this day and age. We all know how to rip CD’s, collect and share music, and move it to our portables for on-the-go music. My server comes from an audiophile standpoint. Long story short, I used to sell expensive stereo equipment. There are people out there right now spending up to $60,000 on CD players. I’d like to show you how to build your own that competes with these on sound quality, is easier to use, much more fun, has more features, and is completely free. edit: my blog: http://opensourceaudiophile.com/</p>

<p>Thursday, September 23 is the first meeting of autumn quarter. We will be meeting in the Ohio Union Senate Room (note the change in location from last year) at 7PM. After a short introduction of the club and a brief description of the blood drive we are sponsoring on the 30th, Matt Meinwald will present an overview of Free operating systems, focusing primarily on GNU/Linux distributions. The main software component of a computer is its operating system, and it is good to know we have plenty of Free and Open Source options for this important role. Matt will discuss and demo popular desktop GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, and OpenSuse, then if time remains, will open discussion to anyone who wishes to talk about his/her favorite distribution. As it turned out, most everyone already knew about these topics, so we discussed what the club does and future meeitngs instead of the original topic. <a href="/~paradigm/minutes.html#htoc7">Minutes</a> for this meeting</p>

<p>On Saturday, May 22 in the Ohio Union, the Ohio State Open Source Club will be hosting a LAN Party from 10 AM Saturday morning until 3 AM Sunday morning. Per our Free and open source philosophy, we will be promoting games that either run natively in Linux or run well in WINE and, while some of the games themselves might not be free or open source in nature, we would like to show how gaming in Linux is not a lost cause. We will be providing a venue for people to come out and play the following computer games:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quake 3</li>
  <li>Quake Live</li>
  <li>Starcraft and Starcraft:Brood War</li>
  <li>Any game that runs natively in Linux (one of us will surely play and we are always looking for good F/OSS games)</li>
  <li>If you’re not sure whether a game runs in WINE or natively on Linux, bring it out and we will investigate together!</li>
</ul>

<p><u>**We will be providing pizza around lunch and dinner times as well as limited amounts of soft drinks (Coke products of course).**</u> This is an open event so anyone and everyone are welcome, including users of all operating systems of course (these games run just fine in Windows), we are just trying to show how Linux users are not stuck when it comes to gaming. Even if you have never played any of these games, but just like gaming, come on out and we will show you the ropes! We will be posting more information about the LAN party as time draws closer and you will be able to find and receive up-to-date information in the following two ways: The LAN Party wiki: http://opensource.osu.edu/lan And/Or you can join our announcement list to get information as it is released: http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce The LAN Party is tentatively being held in the Ohio Union Creative Arts room but this is subject to change, you will be able to get up-to-date information through the channels listed above. The games list is also subject to change as we get suggestions or come up with more ideas. If you have any questions you can send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu. So, join the mailing list or check the wiki for info as it is posted and we hope to see you all there…happy gaming!</p>
