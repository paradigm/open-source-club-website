<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2014/04/14/anti-features-free-and-open-source-software-and-ethics/">Anti-features, Free and Open Source Software, and Ethics</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-14-2014</span>
<p>Thursday, 2014/04/17 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Owen King of the Department of Philosophy will present: Anti-features, Free and Open Source Software, and Ethics.</p>

<p>Abstract:
DRM, spyware, adware, crippleware, backdoors.  What do all these have in common?  For starters, we usually prefer that they not be included in our software.  More specifically, we can say that these are all examples of anti-features.  Unfortunately, most ways people have tried to define ‘anti-feature’ have been inadequate in some way.  My first task, then, is to develop a clear, careful definition of an anti-feature. Next, I turn to the question of whether free and open-source software (FOSS) is compatible with anti-features.  The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a qualified yes.  My third task is to explain why anti-features exist in the first place, and why it is usually a bad thing. In fact, it is often immoral for a programmer to implement an anti-feature.  Finally, I explain why FOSS can be a user’s best defense against anti-features.</p>

<p>This Thursday, May 27th at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Daniel Thau and Brad Hollander will present Bedrock Linux.   Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution founded by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently. For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>

<hr />

<p>also, last week there was a big misunderstanding. I want to make sure that everyone knows the following about our meetings:</p>

<p>They are Discussions.
What does that mean?
- You can speak up at any time for clarification, correction, or otherwise
- If something pans out where the conversation doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, it should be discussed later. (I definitely overreacted when this happened at our last meeting, and I apologize to all)</p>

<p>Let me know if anyone has any questions or clarifications on this. We are a bunch of hackers on equal footing, new members and old. Meetings should reflect this :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
