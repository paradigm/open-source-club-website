<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/05/08/lan-party/">LAN Party</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-08-2011</span>
<p>On Saturday, May 14, from 10:00<strong>AM</strong> to 11:30<strong>PM</strong> in the Ohio Union <a href="http://ohiounion.osu.edu/visit_the_union/building_map/basement">Creative Arts room</a>. The emphasis will be on Free, Open Source games, but people are welcome to play whatever they’d like. Additional details can be found at the <a href="/lan">LAN website</a> as well as a registration form, to help us get a feel for how many people we will have and what games you want to play. Please bring your computer, any game media you might need, as well as a network cable or two, in case some people do not have one. If you have any questions, please send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/05/03/elections/">Elections</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-03-2011</span>
<p>Club elections will be held May 12, 2011. If you are interested in running, please email elections@opensource.osu.edu in order to be listed here and in the meeting announcement. Any OSU student who has been to at least one meeting is eligible to run for president, vice president, or treasurer.</p>

<p>The following people have announced their candidacy.</p>

<p>President: Daniel Thau
Vice President: Paul Schwendenman, Brian Swaney (tentative)
Treasurer: Joel Friedly</p>

<p>In addition, Brian Swaney has proposed the following ballot initiative.</p>

<p>With most discussion surrounding ACTA/COCIA/SHIELD and Wikileaks ex post facto legislation died down, the immediate urgency with which it was hastily voted on and posted is alleviated. The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal. While the Open Source Club will continue its endorsement of EFF, it no longer seems necessary to keep extra clutter on our web page. <em>Shall the Ohio State University Open Source Club remove the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Say NO to online censorship” button?</em></p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/30/mandatory-access-control/">Mandatory Access Control</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-30-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, May 5th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau and Alek Rollyson will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/26/cli-utilities/">CLI Utilities</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-26-2011</span>
<p>On Thursday, April 28, at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will have lightning talks about programs with a command-line interface (CLI). These utilities can be useful in their own right, but often can be connected together with pipes to do new and interesting things. It would be helpful if people interested in presenting signed up with their choices, either by emailing me at meinwald.1@osu.edu or commenting below. This way we can avoid duplication. For now assume each talk can be up to 5 minutes, but that is subject to change.</p>

<p>So far the following people have signed up.</p>

<p>Dan Thau: awk, clive, busybox, graft, pwd, whoami
Morgan Goose: netcat, tar, rsync, iperf, tee
Matt Meinwald: curl, wget
Alek Rollyson: tshark, offlineimap, slock, packer, gnupg, rtorrent</p>

<p>UPE and ACM-W have once again invited us to a quiz bowl competition. On Wednesday, April 20, at 6:30 PM in Lazenby 021, teams of students and faculty will be competing to answer computer science-related questions, perhaps with a few other topics occasionally mixed in. This time, people will be choosing their own teams. You can sign up your team in the CSE advising office on the third floor of Dreese.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/18/breaking-stuff/">Breaking Stuff</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-18-2011</span>
<p>Have you ever run “rm -rf” on the wrong directory, ran “rsync” the wrong way, observed unintended consequences with “find,” or locked yourself out of your own computer? If you can answer yes to any of these and would like to know what else to avoid, or if you can’t and would like to keep it that way, please join us as various club members present how to break things! Everyone who has a story or a deadly command, please come and share it with us, no prior approval needed. Everyone else, prepare to be entertained.</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting on Thursday at 7PM in Dreese 264.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/09/go-board-game-ai/">Go (board game) AI</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-09-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, April 14th at 7PM in Dreese 264, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on open source artificial intelligence for the board game Go.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI’s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/04/open-source-security-tools/">Open Source Security Tools</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-04-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, April 7 at 7PM in Dreese 264, Alek Rollyson will be covering open source security tools from protocol analyzers to vulnerability scanners. This talk is meant as a general overview of tools available as well as their practical applications in security audits and penetration testing. Tools and topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wireshark (protocol analyzer)</li>
  <li>Metasploit (penetration testing suite)</li>
  <li>Ettercap (multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN)</li>
  <li>Aircrack-ng (set of tools for testing wireless security)</li>
  <li>OpenVAS (open source replacement for Nessus, a vulnerability scanner)</li>
  <li>Nmap (swiss army port scanner)</li>
  <li>Password Crackers (John the Ripper, Ophcrack)</li>
  <li>Distros such as Backtrack, Knoppix STD, Damn Vulnerable Linux</li>
  <li>Kippo (simple honeypot with recording capabilities)</li>
  <li>A few hardening techniques and tools (mandatory access control, port knocking, intrusion detection tools, common sense things, old wive’s tales)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This talk is meant for educational purposes only. Techniques demonstrated should only be used on your own systems as using any of these techniques on systems that you do not own has a high probability of you ending up behind bars. These tools will be presented from the perspective of a security auditor and/or a systems administrator wishing to find weak spots in his or her own defenses.

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/01/new-microsoft-partnership/">New Microsoft Partnership</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-01-2011</span>
<p>Amidst our past rivalry, and a fellow technology group that has been all but extinct, we in the Ohio State University Open Source Club have hereby formed a new partnership with the now re-established <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/ntsig">ntSig</a> (website coming soon). ntSig, or New Technology Special Interest Group, is a group sponsored by Microsoft for people who share an interest in software, computers and technology in general. This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft’s apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been <a href="/vista">hostile</a> towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you <a href="/ntsig">opt out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="april-fools">APRIL FOOLS!!!</h3>

<p>We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster. Furthermore, we will never share your information with anyone under any circumstances, per our <a href="/rules">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>If you liked this April Fools’ Day joke, you can check out an example of another related website hoax <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.</p>

<p>This Thursday, March 31 at 7PM in Dreese 264 we will see presentations on window managers and desktop environments. Dan Thau will show the window managers dwm and Openbox as well as LXDE which uses the latter. Mike Yanovich will demonstrate the Awesome window manager and Gnome desktop environment (version 2.x). Alek Rollyson will present Window Manager From Scratch. Alex Lingo will talk about KDE. Mike Bettencourt will introduce Gnome 3. Matt Meinwald will explain the XFCE desktop environment and Compiz.</p>

<p>Note that the order will likely be different than the one above. Hopefully by the end of the meeting, everyone will know enough about window managers to choose the one(s) that suit them best.</p>

<p>This Thursday, March 10 at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will be having lightning talks on the Open Source projects people are working on. If you have something you are working on, please comment below so I can get an idea of the time limits for these talks. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume they are five minutes each and a maximum of two talks per person. If anyone has a gong to help enforce these guidelines, please let me know. We need to do planning during this meeting as well, so please do your best to stay under time, and bring your meeting ideas.</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 3, at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will be having talks on shells. Dan Thau will explain ZSH, an extremely customizable and powerfull shell. Morgan Goose will present on Bash, a familiar one that still has some tricks up its sleeve. Michael Yanovich will demonstrate either ipython or bpython, a python-based shell. Matt Meinwald will show Fish, a friendlier shell. If anyone else has a shell to present, please feel free to talk for a few minutes on it. There are a lot of interesting shells out there, and it would be nice to learn about more.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/02/07/wireless-hacking/">Wireless Hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 02-07-2011</span>
<p>Tonight at 7 pm in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 264, I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering various sub-topics to wireless hacking, however the main point that I want people to take away from this talk is how to secure your own wireless network from these types of attacks. I’ll be covering a brief outline on how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to <strong>try</strong> to protect your network. I’ll be demonstrating these attacks as well, and I’ll be needing help in this endeavor and I encourage people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types or security implementations that I will be covering. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be interesting!</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are <strong>NOT</strong> responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very <strong>easily</strong> accessible on the Internet. I’m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. I know this is late notice but it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I’ll be doing you’ll need a laptop with Linux.</p>

<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu’s and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>More information in general about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC and we’ll help you out.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/07/gimp-image-editing-winter-2011/">Gimp Image Editing - Winter 2011</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-07-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in <strong>Dreese Labs room 264</strong>, Brian Swaney will be demonstrating use of the GIMP image editor. GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.</p>

<p>For those who don’t remember, I did promise to cover the new Gimp 2.8, which was scheduled to be released December 27<sup>th</sup>, 2010<sup>[<a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/gimp-2-8-release-date-announced/">1</a>]</sup>. However, Gimp 2.8 has not yet been released. I expect to have the beta version (2.7.1) as well as the stable version (2.6.10) in case things go wrong. The gimp 2.7 may be unstable, so I can make no promises, and I am aware of at least one feature anticipated in 2.8 that is not included in the 2.7.1 version I found.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “<em>how do I save as a JPEG</em>” to as advanced as “<em>how do I remove braces?</em>” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.</p>

<p>While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what <em>you</em> want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">rendering lightning bolts</a>, to making the picture just… <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">lie</a>. By the time you leave, you should qualify as a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200807020002?f=h_top">Fox News editor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a time-lapsed example of what GIMP is capable of in the right hands, by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hmfrx">hmfrx</a>:</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/04/osu-sign-on-and-openid-now-supported/">OSU Sign-on and OpenID Now Supported</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-04-2011</span>
<p>In response to feedback we received about having to log into our site (and resetting passwords each time), as well as insanely difficult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a>s, we have taken steps to make things a little easier for everyone. Effective immediately, an OSU <code class="highlighter-rouge">name.n</code> will now log any current student, faculty, or staff member into our website, as well as most alumni and former staff. To use it, simply click the link on the left-side of any page titled “OSU Sign-on” and enter your OSU username and password (same password you use for Carmen/grades/etc). Logging in this way will automatically mark your account as <a href="/node/9">identified</a> and give you the ability to post anything without moderator approval, as well as any other options previously unavailable to anonymous or unverified users.</p>

<p>Additionally, we support OpenID. Unlike with your OSU login (which uses Shibboleth), an OpenID will not automatically flagg your account as identified if you register a new account with it. However, you may tie unlimited OpenIDs to your verified account. Using either OpenID or your OSU sign-on, you can now log into our website without ever having to enter a password in our site.</p>

<p>The first time you log in or register on this website, you may need to follow these instructions for one of 3 methods. It is possible to use all or any combination of them to use our website, and you can tie all 3 methods to the same account. This page documents how to use each of the methods and the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as what to do if you have never signed into our website before. You should wind up with the same privileges no matter which method you use. This page does <em>not</em> talk about club membership; we do not formally keep track of membership except as absolutely required by the Ohio State University to maintain formal status as a registered student organization. If you are still looking to be recognized as a member to any degree, we recommend you attend our weekly <a href="/meetings">meetings</a>, register on our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">mailing list</a>, and register on this website (instructions below). <strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend using the same e-mail address on the mailing list and this website (<a href="/mailinglist-info">read more</a>).</p>

<h3 id="osu-sign-on">OSU Sign-on:</h3>

<p>If you are an OSU student, faculty, or staff member, it is recommended that you sign into this website with your OSU internet username, at least the first time you use our website. Do <strong>not</strong> enter this information into our <a href="/user/login" title="login form">login form</a> that appears on every page, but instead use the “<a href="https://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?target=https%3A%2F%2Fopensource.cse.ohio-state.edu%2Fshib_login%2Fnode" title="OSU Sign-on">OSU Sign-on</a>” link - your OSU username and password are considered restricted information, and they are not stored on this website, but verified to us by another OSU service. This login is the same as what you log into for your e-mail, grades, Carmen, and a number of other services, and as long as you are affiliated with OSU in some fashion, you can continue to authenticate through the web authentication service. If you sign in this way, you will <em>automatically</em> inherit privileges of an <a href="/get_verified" title="approved account">approved account</a> for the duration of your session, and within a day OpenID or Drupal sign-ins should include these privileges as well. These privileges may include but are not limited to viewing user profiles, posting content that isn’t sent to a moderation queue (as is the case for anonymous submissions), or voting on polls. You cannot use this option if you are not affiliated with OSU, but you can still gain full access to our website by the methods below.</p>

<p>After your first time logging in, we recommend that you initiate a password reset by signing out and clicking on “<a href="/user/password" title="Request new password">Request new password</a>” so you can set a separate password for your account. Although you can continue logging in with your OSU username and password as long as you’re affiliated, once you graduate OSU and your name.n stops working, will no longer be able to sign in with your name.n. Initiating a password reset “confirms” your account, for technical purposes I won’t explain here, and allows you to sign in without OSU’s single sign-on service (Shibboleth). Once you do this, you can (optionally) set your own password, or add an OpenID so you can sign in with a 3rd-party service.</p>

<h3 id="openid">OpenID:</h3>

<p>You can tie an OpenID to your account from your user <a href="/user" title="profile page">profile page</a> and clicking on the tab labeled <strong>OpenID Identities</strong>. All accounts have permission to do this, and doing so (like with the OSU sign-on) allows you to sign in without entering a password into this website, so you don’t have to create a new password or worry about repeating the same password here as on another website. There is no limit on the number of OpenIDs you can tie to a single account, but we recommend you tie all OpenIDs to your existing <a href="/get_verified" title="verified">verified</a> account instead of creating multiple accounts.</p>

<p>If you do not already have an account on this website, you can register with OpenID, but you will have the same limited privileges as if you register directly, and you won’t have the opportunity to pick your username. Of course, this means you’re entering a password into our website, but you could always just enter something random you’re never going to use (please use a <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords" title="strong password">strong password</a>) then tie the OpenID to your account and use that. If you’re affiliated with OSU, you can also follow the instructions to enable OpenID for your OSU sign-on, and you’ll have full access from OpenID but you will be forced to use your name.n as the username (if you’re just logging in the first time it may take up to a day for the new privileges to migrate over to OpenID).</p>

<p>If you do not have an OSU account, and are not affiliated with the Ohio State University, you are more than welcome to use this website fully, but you will have to have your account <a href="/get_verified" title="verified">verified</a>. This can be done in person with the club’s administration, or by immediately setting your e-mail address to something verifiable when you first sign in. If you do not set it right away on your first time logging in, chances are an administrator will overlook your account and you will need to fill out a <a href="/contact" title="support request">support request</a>. Examples of such e-mail addresses are <code class="highlighter-rouge">SOME_USER</code>@XXX.gov, <code class="highlighter-rouge">STUDENT</code>@<code class="highlighter-rouge">SCHOOL</code>.edu, or something with a clear name from a well-known organization (e.g. fsf.org) where creating multiple free e-mail addresses is out of the question. Examples of e-mail addresses that will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> verify your account are crackmonkey79@gmail.com, anon007@mailinator.com, or viagra@provider.ru. Despite this, registration on our website is completely open. Anybody is welcome on our website, and these account limitations for unidentified users are exclusively meant as an anti-spam measure, not to restrict users.</p>

<h3 id="drupal-sign-in-local">Drupal sign-in (local):</h3>

<p>In addition to the methods above, you may also register directly (local) on our website. The advantage to registering this way is that you get to pick your username, which would automatically be assigned if you use Shibboleth or OpenID. You do not need to be affiliated with the Ohio State University to use this method, but keep in mind that if you are affiliated with OSU then you will need to use your name.n username if you want your account to be compatible with your OSU account. A conflicting username <em>can</em> lock you out from your OSU login. Only an administrator can change your username, and this is the only way to correct the problems that will arise if you try to use your OSU login later on. If you’re not affiliated with OSU, or you have no intention of using the OSU login service, then this doesn’t apply to you. Also, do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> register with the name.n of someone else — it’s not funny, it’s not cute, it won’t accomplish anything for you. We’ve already tested that, and if some wise-ass thinks otherwise, tries it, and the account doesn’t get flagged for abuse, then here’s what will happen: then the next time the owner of that squatted OSU username logs into our site through the OSU login service, they will take control of that account you just registered and automatically reset the password and e-mail address to their own — congratulations, your cleverness just got your <em>OWN</em> account p0wned and you effectively banned yourself from our website.</p>

<p>As with OpenID, you <em>must</em> use a verifiable e-mail address to be granted full access to our website. Although you can immediately sign in, add OpenID accounts, and post with your selected username, you will not be granted full access automatically, and you will have to wait for an administrator to approve your account. This usually happens within less than 1 day, as administrators are automatically alerted about the account creation, but over holidays or breaks when the administrators are not around, it can potentially take longer. Because of this delay, OSU faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to follow the instructions above for using their OSU credentials to access this website; sessions created by the OSU login service are granted full privileges automatically.</p>
