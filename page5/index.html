<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/10/08/security-and-encryption/">Security and Encryption</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-08-2013</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2013/10/10 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, The Ohio State Open Source Club will present “Security and Encryption”. This talk will consist of different members presenting on a variety of topics in the world of personal encryption and protecting your privacy. If you have an interest in security, or cryptographic systems as they apply computing, this is probably the talk for you.</p>

<p>Laptops are encouraged, but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/10/01/awk/">AWK</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-01-2013</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2013/10/03 in Caldwell Labs 120, Daniel Thau will be presenting the AWK programming language.  AWK is an interpreted programming language which excels at text processing and quick-and-dirty one-liners.  It is part of the POSIX standard and will thus be found on just about every unix system, including exceedingly minimal ones.  AWK has a number of relatively unique aspects that can make it quite enjoyable to use - for its target use, an AWK program is often significantly smaller than almost every other language.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/09/16/wireless-security/">Wireless Security</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-16-2013</span>
<p>This Thursday, 2013/09/19 at 7pm, in Caldwell Labs 120, Chris Wallace will present Wireless Security. In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world. DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine. <strong>I reiterate, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</strong> In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/09/12/connecting-to-irc/">Connecting to IRC</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-12-2013</span>
<h4 id="foreward">Foreward</h4>

<p>Every meeting, we mention something about our IRC channel. Some of you may not know what that means, so I wanted to clear everything up, as well as explain how to get chatting with us.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, which is a protocol for communication primarily for group discussion. It is a client-server model, meaning that clients connect to a server and that server tells the client what the other clients are saying. The protocol is also fairly old, originating from 1988.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started-with-weechat">Getting Started with WeeChat</h4>

<p>WeeChat is an extendable IRC client for GNU/Linux. It utilizes a terminal to render its interface, but is crisp and clean with how it presents information. To install, first get WeeChat from your distribution’s package manager. After installation, start weechat from the command line with</p>

<pre>$ weechat-curses</pre>

<p>and watch it fire up!</p>

<p>To get connected to freenode, type the following into weechat</p>

<pre>/connect irc.freenode.net</pre>

<p>You may need to set your name as other users see it, which can be done with</p>

<pre>/nick yourDesiredNick</pre>

<p>After you are fully connected to freenode, join any room you like with</p>

<pre>/join #osuosc</pre>

<h4 id="running-weechat-with-screen">Running WeeChat with screen</h4>

<p>To <strong>idle</strong> with WeeChat, that is, keep your chat session open without ever leaving, one utility that can be used is screen. To start, run:</p>

<pre>$ screen weechat-curses</pre>

<p>To detatch from this session, press control+a, then d. To reattach to this session, type</p>

<pre>$ screen -r</pre>

<p>Feel free to explore around freenode, and other IRC networks, as there are lots of interesting channels with different topics and projects behind them. I hope this has helped you!</p>

<p>This Thursday, September 12, in Caldwell Labs 120, Matt Meinwald will discuss Free HTTP servers, including Apache, Lighttpd, and Nginx. He will go over some of the benefits and limitations of each, and also compare configuration. Some command-line knowledge would be helpful, but no prior web server experience is needed. You will not necessarily walk out an expert on web servers, but by the end of the meeting, you should have the resources to set up a basic web server.</p>

<p>This Thursday, September 5th at 7pm in Caldwell Labs 120, Brad Hollander will present ``Introduction to the Command Line’’.

<p>Thursday 2013/08/29 at 7pm in Dreese Lab 266, Chris Wallace and the Open Source Club will present ``Linux InstallFest and Introduction’’.

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/01/24/gimp-image-editing/">GIMP Image Editing</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-24-2013</span>
<p>This Thursday at 7 pm, in Dreese Lab 369, Brian Swaney will teach us GIMP image editing techniques. The presentation will be interactive and encourage audience participation, so you should bring a laptop with GIMP already installed to follow along. Some techniques covered may include <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. Some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may be covered if time allows, just to show that GIMP can live up to the same standard as <em>other editors whose names are withheld due to trademark licensing concerns</em>, but no prior experience is required.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>The presentation will use 2.8. If you haven’t installed GIMP yet, make sure you install 2.8, and if you have 2.6 installed, you should upgrade to 2.8 if feasible. Differences between the 2 versions will still be covered where applicable.</p>
