<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/06/28/irc-channel-moved-to-osuosc/">IRC Channel moved to #osuosc</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 06-28-2012</span>
<p>Our IRC channel #osu_osc has been moved over to #osuosc on freenode. The older channel is currently setup to forward people over to the newer channel. This was done for several reasons, a few of which are to make our channel name match up with the cloaks we provide (<a href="https://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml">more about how freenode operates</a>), and simplify the channel name. A few new things you may notice, besides the name, are that everyone is +v (voiced) upon joining the channel and a few new modes set. The voice is <a href="http://swhack.com/logs/2011-03-08#T18-50-27">a work around</a> for those who the IRCd may consider typing too fast or pasting anything more than a few lines. Also those with the @osuosc/* cloaks are +e and +I’ed on the room. The +e means that those with the cloaks are exempt from any bans or quiets, and the +I means that those with the cloaks can join if the room becomes +i for any reason in the future (even if temporarily). The ACL (Access Control List) remains the same from the previous room, /msg ChanServ access #osuosc list. For an explanation of all the channel modes set at any give time you can pull up help in two places: <strong>/quote help cmode</strong> or <a href="https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml">freenode’s guide to “Using the network”</a>. (Note the /quote command also works for user modes too, <strong>/quote help umode</strong>.) Also at this time the channel #osuosc-ops was created for those who have privileges on #osuosc to handle any type of dispute that may arise in the future from a ban. This channel will primarily be for handling any type of disputes that may arise from a ban or any other channel management. This channel is logged for internal use of the ops. The rules for the channel remain the same as previously set and remember the channel is still logged.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 24th at 7:00PM in Dreese 369, Daniel Thau will be presenting Bedrock Linux.  Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently.  For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/05/11/elections-latex-and-lan-party/">Elections, LaTeX, and LAN party</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-11-2012</span>
<p>Elections for the OSU Open Source Club officer positions are currently planned for May 17th, 2012. They will take place in the normal meeting room (Dreese 369) and at the normal time (7:00PM EDT). If the date does not work for you and you are a voting club member (ie, you are a student and have attended at least one meeting prior to the vote), please contact the club offers as soon as possible and we will see what we can do. Three positions need to be filled. More details about the responsibilities of each member can be found in the <a href="/constitution">club constitution</a> on our web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>President: Primary responsibility is to ensure a meeting place and topic is set.</li>
  <li>Vice President: Keep the minutes and fill in for the President when he or she is unavailable.</li>
  <li>Treasurer: Manage club funds (and order pizza)</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically the club has had other positions (which are not officially recognized by the university):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Webmaster: manages the club website.</li>
  <li>E-council representative: Attends e-council meetings. Usually appointed by the Treasurer.</li>
</ul>

<p>As is evident from the tone of our club constitution, the club’s original founders seemed to intend for it to be reasonable laid back; none of these positions should be overly stressful. Worst case scenario is the club website has some downtime, the club misses some free pizza, we have to fumble to find a new room, and have to wing a conversation rather than having a pre-set presentation. In addition to the election, Daniel “paradigm” Thau will present the LaTeX markup language. LaTeX is a markup language used by many Mathematicians, Scientists, and Engineers which is particularly capable at typesetting Mathematics. Finally, a reminder: Mothers day is Sunday, May 13th. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas for what to get her, maybe the Open Source Club LAN party the day before on Saturday, May 12th which runs from 2:00PM to 11:30PM (ie, 9.5 hours) at the Ohio Union Interfaith Prayer and Reflection room would be a good place to find something. Maybe. Okay, probably not.</p>

<p>This Thursday, will be a presentation on Python. This presentation will cover many of the basics and bring people up to speed of creating applications in the language. The crash course into Python’s basics will be “follow along” and questions are encouraged. The later half of the presentation will be presenting clever and nifty ways to accomplish various tasks that can be done in Python that are easier than building in other languages. A tour of the standard library is expected along with a tour of some open source Python projects that can be implemented into anything you may want to create.</p>

<p>The meeting will be in Dreese Labs 369 this Thursday, May 10, at 7:00pm, 2012-05-10T1900-0400.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 26th at 7PM in Caldwell 369, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/02/07/introduction-to-gimp-image-editing/">Introduction to GIMP Image Editing</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 02-07-2012</span>
<p>This Thursday at 7:00PM, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Lab</a> room 266, Brian Swaney will be teaching us the basics of <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> image editing. This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html">other proprietary and expensive image editors</a>, some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated.</p>

<p>This Thursday at 7:00PM, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Lab</a> room 266, Scott Cantor will be presenting on OSU’s <a href="https://webauth.service.ohio-state.edu/%7Eshibboleth/">central web-based authentication</a> system, <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a>. Many of Ohio State’s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.</p>

<p>Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called <a href="http://saml.xml.org/">SAML</a> that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called “federated identity”. The key benefit to users is the ability to leverage a password or other credentials shared with a trusted site (such as OSU’s login service) to access a variety of other sites without disclosing one’s password to them.</p>

<p>Scott Cantor, the administrator of the OSU web login environment, and a developer on the Shibboleth project for about 10 years, will discuss the project, the SAML standard and federated identity in general, and their future directions. OSU’s various activities in this area will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Thursday, February 2nd at 7:00PM in Dreese 266 Daniel Thau will be presenting Unix CLI Utilities such as grep, sed and awk.  These tools are present on every Unix machine, and so if one ever finds him or herself on someone else’s Unix box without their language of choice, her or she can always fall back to these tools.  Moreover, they’re quite good at manipulating text - the fundamental necessity for managing a Unix system.

<p><em>Thursday January 26, 2012</em>
<em>Dreese Lab 266</em></p>

<p>Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Haskell.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing the series on introductory Haskell programming we will talk
about abstractions common to everyday Haskell. This will include I/O and
you should be able to wrap your head around existing code. We didn’t make
it to the abstractions last week, so this week will be somewhat abstract.
Towards the end we should hopefully get something fairly practical
discussed.</p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it last week, we covered most* of the
material up to and including Chapter 8 of Learn You A
Haskell<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters</a>.
The topics in Chapter 8 will probably receive some attention again before
moving onto the other topics.</p>

<p>The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</p>

<p>There is also talk of doing some practical group projects. My suggestion is
going to be to work through some of the exercises in Learn You a Haskell or
Real World Haskell (free online books). If you are interested in this, we
will probably be organizing something like this during the meeting. If you
miss the meeting but would like to be involved, it will likely be a common
discussion topic in the OSC IRC channel.</p>
