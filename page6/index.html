<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2013/01/22/irc/">IRC</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-22-2013</span>
<p>This Thursday, <abbr title="1359072000">2013/01/24 at 7:00pm</abbr> (EST, -5G MT) in Dreese Labs 369, Michael Yanovich will take you upon a journey of exploring the depths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a>. He will be covering: what IRC is, what IRC is used for, and most importantly how to interface with IRC. From general observations, it appears that many in the club use IRC and many more would like to participate in the IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/osuosc">#osuosc</a> on <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a>. <!--break-->(<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#osuosc">#osuosc webchat</a>) The goal of this talk is to provide information on using IRC in a terminal that is remotely connected a dedicated machine running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> variant in a way that facilitates easy access and <a href="https://xkcd.com/705/">optimal uptime</a>. While there exist countless IRC clients for countless platforms this talk is going to focus on using IRC from a GNU/Linux machine that is left on 24/7, “dedicated”, so that one can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></a> into the machine (from Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux) and pull up their session the way they left it. This is often called “idling” and most people on the larger IRC networks often “idle”. The software combination that will be described in detail for this talk is <a href="http://weechat.org/"><abbr title="Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat">WeeChat</abbr></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>. If you would like to follow along, please bring a laptop running a GNU/Linux variant and have a working Internet connection. There will be no slides and this will be a live demonstration of how to set up WeeChat and tmux on the GNU/Linux distribution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> 6 “Squeeze”.
<br /><br />
<b>Preparations:</b> You can install tmux through most package managers on most GNU/Linux <a href="http://bedrocklinux.org/">distributions</a>. WeeChat should be downloaded and compiled from source to obtain the latest version, <a href="http://weechat.org/download/stable/">0.4.0</a> (which was released this past Sunday, 2013/01/20). The compilation of WeeChat will briefly be demonstrated.
<br /><br />
<b>Students:</b> The <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/"><abbr title="The Ohio State University Open Source Club">OSUOSC</abbr></a> offers access to a system designed specifically for “idling”. You must be a student to request access and access can only be given in person. Please contact an officer of the club today for more information!
<br /><br />
<b>Afterwards:</b> There will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"><abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr></a> signing party after the IRC meeting. If you would like to participate please bring a piece of paper with necessary information to sign your key (full name, e-mail address associated with your key, key ID and/or your key fingerprint, and where to obtain your public key), as we will only be exchanging papers for the signing party. Also, please bring at least one government issued photo identification with you if you would like others to sign your PGP key, individual members may have more strict requirements for signing your PGP key. If you have any questions please feel free to <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/contact">contact us</a>. Additionally, we will go over how to create a PGP key during this segment.</p>

<p>Thursday, October 25th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 266, Daniel Thau will be presenting an overview of various advanced functionality for the Vim text editor.  This talk is not intended to fully educate the audience on the use of the discussed functionality so much as make the audience aware of the advanced functionality Vim has to offer in order to have something to work towards.  Comfort with the basics of Vim would be useful but not required.</p>

<p>Some of the items planned on being discussed are:
- text-objects
- marks
- registers
- macros
- folding
- syntax highlighting
- mappings
- buffers/windows/tabs
- accessing remote files (scp://, ftp://, etc)
- running shell commands from within Vim
- the nuances of visual mode
- several cmdline commands such as :s and :g
- autocmds
- cmdline-window
- tags
- plugins
- diffs
- quickfix
- ins-completion
- basic vimscript
- automatic indentation</p>

<p>If there is anything else you would like, do not hesitate to ask about it.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/10/04/introduction-to-vim/">Introduction to Vim</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-04-2012</span>
<p>Thursday, October 11th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau will be presenting an introduction to the Vim text editor.  Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as, but not limited to, programming), the benefits can far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>In the past, Daniel’s presentations on Vim have attempted to provide benefit, for everyone from those completely new to Vim to more experienced users.  Instead, two talks on Vim will be given this time around: one for those who are new to Vim and another intended to benefit those already comfortable with Vim.  This first talk on October 11th will be solely an introduction; it will focus on the basics and be at a relatively slow pace.</p>

<p>Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux, as well as other platforms. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install Vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2012/08/24/wi-fi-hacking/">Wi-Fi Hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 08-24-2012</span>
<p>I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering Wi-Fi Hacking on 2012/08/30 at 7:00pm (20120830T1900-0400 for those who love ISO8601 compliant dates) in Dreese Labs 266. What I want people to walk away from this talk with is the knowledge of how to <b>try</b> to protect their Access Points (AP) the best they can with currently available technology. I will start off with a basic introduction into simple Electricity and Magnetism (E&amp;M) and quickly move into some of the layers of the OSI Model of networking involved. The bulk of the talk will be a live demonstration of testing the security of WEP and WPA (1 and 2). I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types of security implementations that I will be demonstrating. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be a treat!</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are <b>NOT</b> responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very <b>easily</b> available on the Internet via your favourite search engine.</p>

<p>I’m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I’ll be doing you’ll need a laptop with Linux. Also, please try to get aircrack-ng installed before the meeting, as the software will not work with any wireless card available in any laptop. So, there is a chance you may not be able to do these attacks with the given software.</p>

<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/
For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=osuosc">#osuosc</a> on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 2012/09/22 – The presentation used during the talk is now available on this page. Don’t forget that in addition to files being hosted here, they are also available at my personal website, https://yanovich.net/.public/wifi/</p>
