<p>Continuing the series on introductory Haskell programming we will talk about abstractions common to everyday Haskell. This will include I/O and you should be able to wrap your head around existing code. We didn’t make it to the abstractions last week, so this week will be somewhat abstract. Towards the end we should hopefully get something fairly practical discussed.</p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it last week, we covered most* of the material up to and including Chapter 8 of Learn You A Haskell. The topics in Chapter 8 will probably receive some attention again before moving onto the other topics.</p>

<p>The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work. If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell Platform for your favorite operating system: http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</p>

<p>There is also talk of doing some practical group projects. My suggestion is going to be to work through some of the exercises in Learn You a Haskell or Real World Haskell (free online books). If you are interested in this, we will probably be organizing something like this during the meeting. If you miss the meeting but would like to be involved, it will likely be a common discussion topic in the OSC IRC channel.</p>

<p>January 5th, 2012 at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Paul Schwendenman, Meisam Fathi Salmi and Daniel Thau will be giving presentations on Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS).  DVCSs are distributed systems which keep track of software revisions.  These are usually, but not necessarily, used to manage programming projects.  Daniel will go over the idea behind a DVCS, as well as some of the stuff going on under the hood in one of them (git).  Meisam will continue presenting on git, going over things such as the git commands, config file, hooks, and daemon.  Paul will present on Bazaar, another DVCS.</p>

<p>Thursday, December 1st at 7:00PM in Dreese room 266, a number of our members will be presenting on various Open Source Operating Systems.

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/11/07/clojure/">Clojure</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 11-07-2011</span>
<p>November 10th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Maxim Kim will be giving a presentation on Clojure. Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p>

<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.  When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>

<p>This Thursday, in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266, Alex Lingo will host his infamous <em>This Week in Slashdot</em>™ discussion. As is the general format, Alex will display and discuss major events in technology, with feedback from the audience. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (often abbreviated <strong>/.</strong>) is a nerd-oriented news website where the readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the front page, with a new page typically appearing every couple of hours. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then <a href="http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml">moderated</a> by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article. Alex’s discussion will attempt to mimic this format, and provoke civilized (yeah right!) discussion and debate about news topics that matter to nerds.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/10/24/regular-expressions/">Regular Expressions</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 10-24-2011</span>
<p>October 27th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Regular Expressions. Regular Expressions is a system for pattern recognition in text which is extremely useful for text processing. This talk may be especially appealing to up-and-coming *nix admins, since such systems rely heavily on text for things like configuration, but should be useful for anyone interested in software. The talk will mostly use examples with the grep and sed utilities, which are almost certainly already installed on your Linux or OSX laptops if you’re bringing one along. If you’re bringing a Windows laptop, grabbing Windows versions of such utilities (or Cygwin, or Linux in a VM) may be useful if you want to play along, but shouldn’t be required to benefit from the talk.</p>

<p>October 20th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Paul Schwendenman will be giving a presentation on Xiki. Xiki is a modified version of emacs created specifically for web development with the goal of having an easy learning curve. Additionally, there will be a discussion and vote regarding some changes to the club constitution. <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0AYhc9WicNcjbZGNiM2dmMjhfMzhjemoybnNkcA&amp;hl=en_US">Link to slides</a></p>

<p>October 13th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Vim, an extremely powerful text editing program. Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost. Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it. Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others. Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim. Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/09/27/making-pictures-lie/">Making Pictures Lie</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 09-27-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, in Dreese Lab room 266, I will demonstrating how you can make pictures lie using only open source software. Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I’m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is <em>just</em> as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. I also do not know the level of audience to expect, I don’t script or rehearse my presentations, and simply impressing you isn’t going to teach you anything. Therefore, the presentation shall be interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>Thursday, September 29th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 266, Michael Yanovich will be covering wireless security with a heavy regard towards wireless hacking. He will be covering how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to try to protect your network. He will be demonstrating these attacks as well, and he encourages people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate (if your wireless card can not run the available software, he will be providing a sample dump for you to play around with, this will be available at the meeting). Everyone is encouraged to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.  Michael is am bringing my own equipment for demonstrative purposes and he encourage everyone to participate in the presentation.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment.

<p>Come to a hands-on open hardware/open source Arduino microcontroller introduction given by the staff of First Year Engineering (FYE) program with an emphasis on their new lab centered about the “Advance Energy Vehicle (AEV),” controlled, of course, by an Arduino.  FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.  A Matlab/Arduino interface created by Dr. Campa at Mathworks will be displayed, including a “real-time” data graphing example along with simple servo and motor control.  Some other Arduino related tools, such as the fritzing.org software, will also be displayed and discussed.  A pitch will be given for ideas, and possibly programming help, in simplifying the AEV code as much as possible for students with Matlab, but no C++, background.</p>
